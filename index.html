<h1>Michele Gomez :)</h1>
<p>I am a girl who codes from Atlanta, GA. I will be in the 11th grade in the fall and I am looking forward to learning more about colleges and really focusing on my school work. I live at home with my mom, dad, brother, my two younger sisters. When I'm not coding, you can find me hanging out with my friends or listening to music.</p>
